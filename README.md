# babel-webpack-tutorial
Just practicing and learning to use babel and webpack.

Gist of it is to setup a webpack config file to output a bundle.js file that babel makes.

After config is setup, use ```npm start``` to start **webpack-dev-server** during development which will continuously keep bundle.js updated as you make changes. Then use ```npm run build``` when you're all done.
